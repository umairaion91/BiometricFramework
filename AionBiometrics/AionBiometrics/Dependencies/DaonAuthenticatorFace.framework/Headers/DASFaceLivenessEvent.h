 @typedef DASFaceLivenessEvent
 @brief Categorizes the different liveness events that can occur whilst processing live video.
 @constant DASFaceLivenessEventNone                     Default value. No event detected.
 @constant DASFaceLivenessEventReset                    Lost track of face, so liveness analysis will restart.
 @constant DASFaceLivenessEventPassive                  Passive has been detected.
 @constant DASFaceLivenessEventBlink                    A blink has been detected.
 @constant DASFaceLivenessEventSpoof                    A spoof has been detected.
 @constant DASFaceLivenessEventInitializing             Face liveness is initializing. A valid face must be presented.
 @constant DASFaceLivenessEventStarted        Face liveness has started. User should be asked to hold the camera in place.
 @constant DASFaceLivenessEventTracking       Face liveness is tracking. User should be asked to move the camera towards their face.
 @constant DASFaceLivenessEventAnalyzing      Face liveness is analyzing and generating a liveness score.
 @constant DASFaceLivenessEventCompleted      Face liveness has completed analysis and the liveness score will be compared against the liveness threshold.
